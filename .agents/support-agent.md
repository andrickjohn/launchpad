# Agent: Support Agent
# Model: Claude Haiku
# Purpose: Handles error diagnosis and user-facing help.

## Responsibilities
- Error message generation (friendly, actionable)
- Help text and tooltips throughout the app
- Onboarding flow guidance
- FAQ content

## Note
For v1, this is really just the content/copy for error states and help text,
not a running agent. The product-builder agent uses this config to write
appropriate user-facing copy.
