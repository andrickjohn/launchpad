# Workflow: Growth Experiments

## Purpose: Systematic testing of outreach approaches

## Trigger: User creates a new experiment OR AI suggests one (Overachiever)

## Steps:

### Step 1: Hypothesis
- What are we testing? (template, subject line, send time, channel)
- What do we expect? (higher open rate, more replies, faster conversion)
- How do we measure it? (specific metric + target)

### Step 2: Setup
- Create variant (B version of whatever we're testing)
- Split audience (50/50 or user-defined)
- Set duration (minimum 7 days or 50 sends per variant)

### Step 3: Execution
- System automatically routes to variants
- Track metrics separately per variant
- No interference during test period

### Step 4: Analysis
- Compare metrics between variants
- Statistical significance check (simple: >20% difference with >50 samples)
- AI analysis of why one performed better

### Step 5: Decision
- Winner becomes the default
- Loser archived with learning
- Log experiment results for future reference
