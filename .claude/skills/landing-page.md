# Skill: Landing Page — LaunchPad

## Purpose
The landing page is at `/` (root route). For now it's a simple entry point.
Since LaunchPad is a personal tool, the landing page is minimal:
- Product name and one-line description
- Login / Sign up button
- Brief feature overview (3 cards for the 3 screens)

## Design
- Clean, modern, dark/light theme support
- Hero section with clear CTA
- No pricing page needed (personal tool)
- Mobile responsive

## If opened to other founders later
The landing page can be expanded with:
- Pricing section
- Testimonials
- Detailed feature breakdown
- Comparison table (vs manual process, vs expensive SaaS)
But this is deferred. Build minimal first.
