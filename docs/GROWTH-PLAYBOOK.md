# Growth Playbook — LaunchPad

## This is a personal tool — "growth" means making it better for you.

### Week 1-2: Learn
- Use LaunchPad for your first real campaign
- Note every friction point
- Track: what works, what's slow, what's missing
- Check: are the AI drafts actually good? Do you edit them heavily?

### Week 3-4: Optimize
- Review: which templates got the best response rates?
- Review: which prospect sources yielded the best leads?
- Adjust: refine scoring criteria based on real conversion data
- Adjust: update Campaign Wizard prompts based on what actually works

### 30-Day Buyer Receptivity Review
- What % of outreached prospects responded?
- What % converted to paid?
- Which signals most reliably predicted a purchase?
- If response rate < 20% or conversion < 5%, re-evaluate channel and persona

### 60-Day Competitive Position Review
- Are the alternatives in your competitive analysis still accurate?
- Have new tools or workaround patterns emerged?
- Which positioning angles actually resonated in conversations?
- Update your approach based on real feedback

### 90-Day Revenue Forecast Reconciliation
- Compare actual results to your projections
- Which assumptions were right? Which were wrong?
- If tracking below expectations: is it a channel problem, a product problem, or a messaging problem?
- Adjust strategy accordingly

### Month 2-3: Expand
- If LaunchPad works well for you, consider:
  - Adding more campaign types
  - Improving the AI prompts with your real data
  - Building features you wished existed
  - Maybe opening it to other solo founders?
